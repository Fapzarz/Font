PANGRAM PANGRAM
END USER LICENCE AGREEMENT
9394-6010 Québec inc. (Pangram Pangram) (hereinafter, the “Licensor”) offers access to the right to
use sets of characters of one particular face and size (referred to as a “Font” or the “Fonts”).
Your access and usage of the Fonts is subject to the conditions contained herein, all of which constitute
a legal agreement between you (the "Licensee") and the Licensor (hereinafter the “License”). By
installing, accessing and/or using the Fonts, the Licensee acknowledges to have read, understood and

If you do not agree to this License, you are invited to discuss the issue with the Licensor. The Licensor
is an independent design studio that thrives by keeping customers satisfied and is open to new ways of
providing a better service. The Licensor believes that Fonts with unreasonable restrictions do not
ultimately contribute to anyone's satisfaction and tries its best to keep licensing adaptable to as many
workflows as possible.
